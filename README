The files ML_SP_* contain a proof of soundness for structural
polymorphism based on local constraints [1]
  ML_SP_Definitions: basic definitions
  ML_SP_Infrastructure: structural lemmas on kinds and types
  ML_SP_Soundness: lemmas on derivations and proof of type soundnes
  ML_SP_Domain: proof of lemmas concerning polymorphic variants

All these development are extensions of the original proofs of Arthur
Chargueraud, accompanying "Engineering formal metatheory".
Other files are included almost identical from it.
The above 4 files were either heavily edited, or completely new
(ML_SP_Domain).

All the above development were checked with coq 8.1pl3.
You can compile them with "sh build.sh"
